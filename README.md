ðŸ”§ Mechanical Engineer | IoT Enthusiast | Software Advocate

Hello there! Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer who found his calling at the intersection of IoT and software. Open source is one of my favorite playgrounds, and I'm proud to create and contribute to projects that push the boundaries actively.

ðŸ“œ Track Record:

* April 2016: Developed the first 433Mhz to MQTT bridge. [Details](https://1technophile.blogspot.com/2016/04/433tomqttto433-bidirectional-gateway.html).
* November 2016: Expanded the project by integrating Infrared capabilities into the MQTT bridge. [Details](https://1technophile.blogspot.com/2016/11/433nIRtomqttto433nIR-bidirectional-esp8266.html).
* November 2017: The first reading of a BLE broadcaster device (Mi Flora) was achieved using an ESP8266 paired with an HM10. [Details](https://1technophile.blogspot.com/2017/11/mi-flora-integration-to-openmqttgateway.html).
* December 2017: Pioneered Mi Flora reading with an ESP32. [Details](https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/issues/282).
* March 2019: Integrated LORAtoMQTT and MQTTtoLORA functionalities to OpenMQTTGateway. [Details](https://1technophile.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-v0.html).
* March 2020: Helpful Engineers: Covid 19 temperature detection project help.
* October 2021: Launched [Theengs decoder](https://decoder.theengs.io/), a dedicated BLE decoding library.
* February 2022: Introduced [Theengs Gateway](https://gateway.theengs.io/), the refined sibling of OpenMQTTGateway tailored for servers.
* July 2022: Released the [Theengs App](https://app.theengs.io/), a mobile application designed to read various BLE sensors.
* January 2023: Unveiled the [Theengs Plug](https://shop.theengs.io/products/theengs-plug-smart-plug-ble-gateway-and-energy-consumption), marking the first Plug and Play OpenMQTTGateway BLE gateway combined with a SmartPlug.
* February 2023: Created adaptive scanning with @DigiH. The OpenMQTTGateway BLE scanner automatically adapts its parameter depending on the surrounding devices.
